```bash
npm i -D @okane-no/fiken-sdk
```

### Using Personal API Token

```ts
let client = new FikenClient(TOKEN: 'personal-api-token')
```

### Using Client crededentials (Coming soon)

```ts
let client = new FikenClient(TOKEN: getAccessToken(clientId, clientSecret))
```

## Note

* Pagination and Filtering headers are not implemented yet
* The API client is generated from an modified OpenAPI Spec that can be found in spec directory, as the original OpenAPI specification files for Fiken API 2.0.0 has an 'example' capitalized, causing errors.
